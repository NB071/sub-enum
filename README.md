# Subdomain Discovery Tool
Overview

This tool is designed to automate the discovery of subdomains for a given domain. It leverages multiple popular tools and techniques to gather subdomain information and compiles the results into a single output file. The tool includes functionalities for running external subdomain enumeration tools, appending their results, and performing Google dorking to uncover additional subdomains.
Features

        Sublist3r
        Subfinder
        Assetfinder
        Findomain
    Google Dorking: Searches Google for subdomains using a query to enhance discovery.
    Result Aggregation: Collects and aggregates results from different tools into a single output file.
